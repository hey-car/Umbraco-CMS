    CAREFUL!
    ========
    
    ONLY edit this if a certain change NEEDS to go into the config file of EVERYBODY contributing to the project.
    
    After first build you will get your own web.config, which is no included in source control.
    
    In the web.config you can edit all you want, it won't be overwritten, but it WILL be altered by this transform file.
    
    The transforms in this file only apply to debugging, not to the web.config that will be released, see web.Template.Release.config for that
