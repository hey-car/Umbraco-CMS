* Any packages that have pages containing Umbraco Controls should now have a 
DependencyLoader registered on them, otherwise the controls will not down register client files
to be downlaoded (perhaps theres a better way to implement this... (i.e. check if a DependencyLoader
exists in the current context, and if it doesn't it registers the scripts?)
